Customer Segmentation with K-Means Clustering

📊 Project Overview
This project aims to segment customers based on their spending behavior and annual income using K-Means Clustering. By identifying distinct customer groups, businesses can tailor their marketing strategies to enhance customer satisfaction and increase sales.

🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab

📂 Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Mall Customers Dataset, which contains information about customers including their annual income and spending scores.

📑 Project Steps
1. Data Loading and Preprocessing
   - Loaded the dataset and selected relevant columns (Annual Income and Spending Score).
   - Normalized the data for better clustering.

2. K-Means Clustering
   - Applied the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters (K).
   - Implemented K-Means Clustering with the chosen K value.

3. Data Visualization
   - Visualized the clustered data using scatter plots to identify customer segments.

4. Output
   - Saved the final segmented dataset as `Customer_Segments.csv`.

📈 Results
The clustering results show distinct customer segments based on their annual income and spending behavior. The visualization provides insights into how customers are grouped, allowing for targeted marketing strategies.

💰 Monetization Strategy
- Offering customer segmentation services to eCommerce and retail businesses on platforms like Fiverr.
- Writing an SEO-optimized LinkedIn post to attract businesses needing marketing optimization.

📝 Future Work
- Enhance the model by incorporating additional features such as age and gender.
- Explore advanced clustering techniques like Hierarchical Clustering and DBSCAN.
